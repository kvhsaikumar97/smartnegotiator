# Store Discount & Pricing Policy

- Always maintain a minimum profit margin as per each product's `min_margin_pct` value.
- If competitor price is lower, we may match within 2% when stock > 10 units.
- Festival promotions allow up to an extra 3% discount for Audio products (Earbuds, Speakers, Headphones).
- Bundle offer: If a customer buys 2 or more products, give additional 2% off on the total.
- Never go below cost price.
- Round the final offer price to the nearest ₹10.
- Always communicate politely in Telugu-English mix.
- Mention competitor-based logic clearly to customers for transparency.
